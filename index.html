        <div class="sub-heading-two">Here at Mighty Estates, LLC, our goal is to help positively transform the lives of the individuals and communities in which we operate. We can only do this by respecting all individuals with which we interact as we want to leave everyone in a better state than when we met. Due to this, we have very strict guidelines regarding inspections and walkthroughs. In no particular order</div><br/>

It is critical that we know the names and contact information of anyone coming to the inspection<span class="text-bold"> including your client, contractor, property manager, etc.</span> For the safety and security of everyone involved, if you have not RSVP’d for the inspection, you will not be allowed to view the property.

You must respect the property by not damaging anything in the property. Please also respect people’s belongings and do not move anything that does not belong to you.

While we understand viewing the physical condition of the property is important to you creating estimates, please simply estimate with a margin of error for anything you are unable to access out of courtesy to the property occupants

This is a surefire way to be removed from all future viewings. During inspections, we ask that also not pepper the occupants with questions. You are typically one of many people asking questions which can be overbearing for some people

We have set schedules for walkthroughs with the goal of minimizing disruption and inconvenience in the lives of the occupants. If you are unable to make an inspection/walkthrough on time, then please send a representative (e.g. your contractor) who can.

Many occupants will take your comments in a negative way and it can negatively impact their mood and openness to showing the property. Some will also be agitated and combative. It is therefore in your best interest to simply keep your comments, positive or negative, to yourself.
